    <p>This is a simple home version of butter chicken, also known as murgh or chicken makhani, a popular dish in Indian restaurants. It is best served with naan, an Indian bread, or basmati rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup plain non-fat yogurt </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tandoori masala powder</li>
        <li>1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Stir the yogurt and tandoori masala powder in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; add the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Drain and discard any excess marinade.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Puree the onion, ginger, and garlic with the water in a blender until it forms a smooth paste; set aside.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot oil until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet. Fry the onion paste in the hot oil until the moisture is mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the garam masala and chili powder over the mixture; cook for 1 minute more. Pour in tomato sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook another 5 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Return chicken to the skillet along with the half-and-half; bring to a boil. Add butter, fenugreek leaves, and salt; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until chicken pieces are no longer pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
