    <h2>Steps to Cook Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Marinate the Chicken: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, lemon juice, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well to coat evenly.</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Rice: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, bring 5 cups of water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add green cardamom, cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70-80% cooked (it should still be firm when bitten). Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Fry the Onions: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat ghee or oil.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced onions and fry until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Layer the Biryani: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani pot, spread a layer of the marinated chicken.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of the partially cooked rice over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle half of the fried onions, half of the chopped mint leaves, half of the chopped coriander leaves, and a few slit green chilies over the rice.</li>
                <li>Drizzle half of the saffron milk over this layer.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layering process with the remaining chicken, rice, fried onions, mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chilies, and saffron milk.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Dum Cooking: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix warm milk, rose water, and kewra water.</li>
                <li>Drizzle this mixture over the top layer of the biryani.</li>
                <li>Seal the pot with aluminum foil or cover with a tight-fitting lid. If using dough, roll it into a long rope and use it to seal the edge of the lid to the pot.</li>
                <li>Place the sealed pot on a tawa (griddle) and cook on low heat for 30-40 minutes. This is the dum method where the biryani cooks in its steam.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Once done, let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before opening the seal.</li>
                <li>Gently fluff the rice with a fork, mixing the layers together.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fried onions and serve hot with raita or mirchi ka salan.</li>
            </ol>
